This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. "World of Uppsala University" is a very simple, 
text based adventure game. 

In this version, it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
That's all.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.
